# Pyclitr

Pyclitr is a small tool for listing tasks on the command line. It works based on the currently opened directory from which the user calls pyclitr.

I wrote about half a year ago, and am currently replacing it with a new, improved implementation written in Go, [goclitr](https://github.com/jrenslin/goclitr). Consider this project as outdated. I'm uploading it mainly for archival purposes.

## Inspirations / Thanks

[Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/): 
For both user interaction and its de facto JSON storage structure. The only slight advantage pyclitr has over taskwarrior is if you really need a directory-specific task list.
